### Final Project for ABB Tech Academy

My topic for the final project was "Analyzing customer churn in banking". Since it is impossible to find real-life bank customer data as an open source, I took a churn data from Kaggle, customized it so it become suitable for customer churn analysis in banking sector. 

As a next step I decided which questions should be answered in the end and which insights should we see. The questions are as follows:
1. Which customers are leaving?
2. Which customers are likely to churn shortly?
3. Why are they leaving?
4. What can you do to reduce churn?

I used:
1. SQL queries to explore and understand the data, to answer research questions to generate valuable insights for the business
2. Python to examined data variables, their datatypes, summary statistics, data quality. This process also included distribution analysis of each variable in the dataset to identify valuable business insights, and then cross-correlation analysis to study relationships between variables, and identify variables of interests that can help raise data questions to solve the business problem at hand.
3. QlikSense to highlight the importance of understanding customer demographics, account information, and transaction behavior in predicting and preventing customer churn. 

Enjoy!
